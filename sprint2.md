# Sprint 2

### Before the iteration
- Meet with your group to discuss what needs to be done and how to get it done
- Create and assign issues on GitHub
- Set the issueâ€™s milestone to the current iteration (sprint2)
- Provide a clear title and description in the issues
- Each person should have several (at least 3 per person)
### During the iteration
- Communicate with your group regularly
- Frequently commit code throughout the entire iteration
- Link commits to the relevant issue (example: #3 or gh-3 in commit log message for issue #3)
- Ensure that your commits use the GitHub account you provided us
- Close the issue when it is completed
### End of the iteration
- Your project should be in a working state
- Post your individual reflection as a bullet point list covering what you had planned to do, what you actually did, what you did not do, what problems you encountered (each person do this individually)
- Discuss with your group on the iteration and plan to adapt accordingly
- Receive feedback from the TAs on your individual contributions
- Ask questions to improve

# What you need to turn in:

1. As a group: Demo Working Software in class on your assigned day. Ten minutes or less per group.
2. Individually: In a directory in your github class project repo named sprint2, create a .md
file named with your netid with a reflection on sprint2. Use the template named sprint.template.md
in this ClassInfo github page.
3. Individually: In the same sprint2 directory, create a file named netid.commits.txt (use your netid
  in place of netid). In that file, show all source code lines you committed for this sprint. Use git
  blame and filter only the lines from this sprint (git blame filename.cpp | grep your-user-name > output_file). 
  Do not include binary files (like images) or files
  auto-generated from tools. Do include those files in the reflection where you list the files you worked on.
